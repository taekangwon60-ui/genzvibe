# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a Next.js application built with the assistance of an AI coding companion. The goal is to create a modern, visually appealing, and feature-rich web application.

## Implemented Features (v1)

*   **Initial Setup:** Standard Next.js project with App Router.
*   **Styling:** Basic styling with Tailwind CSS.

## Current Plan: V1 - Modern Landing Page

The current goal is to transform the default Next.js starter page into a modern and engaging landing page for an AI code assistant.

### Steps:

1.  **Update Global Styles (`globals.css`):**
    *   Introduce a modern color palette with gradients.
    *   Apply a subtle noise texture to the background for a premium feel.
    *   Improve typography for better readability.
2.  **Redesign Main Page (`page.tsx`):**
    *   Create a compelling hero section with a headline, description, and a call-to-action button.
    *   Add a section to highlight key features of the AI assistant, using icons for visual appeal.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive and looks great on all screen sizes.
